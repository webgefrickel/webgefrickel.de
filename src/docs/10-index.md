Welcome to kalong. It looks like you've just started development on a
new project. You should change this readme-file (have a look at
/src/docs/conventions.md) and provide some useful information on this
starting page for people using this styleguide.

First time using kalong? Please read the docs:

- [Getting Started](docs/development/getting-started)
- [General Conventions](docs/development/conventions)
