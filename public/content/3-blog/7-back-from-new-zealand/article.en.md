Title: I am back!

Intro: Exactly one month ago I arrived back in Germany from a very nice, long vacation. I've been in Singapore for one week and travelled New Zealand for almost two months. It was fucking awesome. Lot's of hiking, lot's of craft beer and good food, lot's of time for myself and my wife. Because I had no computer with me.

To be fair: I had my smartphone with me for emergencies, listening to music and the occasional booking of a hostel, but it was switched off about 80% of the time. Travelling is just so much easier with some kind of internet-capable device nowadays.  
Taking two months off was quite a lot of work to prepare properly, but in the end everything went fine. No emergencies, no late-night-calls, no nothing at all. I felt kind of expendable when I came back and I only had about 6-7 important (but not time-critical), work-related emails. On the other side I felt really relieved: the world keeps on turning — even if I am on the other side of it. All too often I — and especially some of my customers — forget that »that important thing you should have done yesterday« is __not__ that important or urgent as we believe (or make) it to be.

I highly recommend to anybody to take a break. Switch off. Leave your computer, tablet and smartphone at home. Get outside, get rid of all the digital distractions and clear your mind. Even if it's just for a week. While it can be hard coming back to work after a long break, I feel damn refreshed. Ok, I had to get my head back into »work-mode«, thinking about CSS-bugs, progressive enhancement and whatnot (which is quite different to the »What's for dinner?« or »Is this a good spot for the tent?«-thinking of the last two months), but that happened faster than expected.

Two months is a long period of time in anything web-related. New browser versions, new tools, frameworks, libraries and bugs; heck: even new social networks, maybe even new-and-already-outdated. But I realized that it doesn't really matter. If you are dedicated with web-development, you have to learn new things constantly anyways. So two months off-time do not matter at all. What I learned and hereby am trying to say is: you don't have to keep up with all the latest stuff everyday. It's perfectly fine to take a step back and relax. And taking a break really helps to focus on the important stuff (hint: it's not rollup vs. browserify or gulp vs. npm-scripts or anything like that).

That said, it's hard to *not* fall back into old (bad) work-related habits, like checking emails first thing in the morning or working late and overengineering everything. But since I don't want to go back to my old pre-vacation working-on-weekends life, I'll try to behave, at least for now. Let's see how long that's gonna last.

I'm back. I'm relaxed. I'm focused. And I have 4.5k photos to sort.

PS: I have decided to make this blog more personal, so prepare for some utter ramblings about outdoor-gear, music and other random stuff. People asked for it, so here we go.
