Title: Why I decided to blog

Intro: I read a lot of blogs and I gain tons of knowledge doing that â€” all for free.  I have decided it is time to give something back in return.

I had a blog a few years ago. Lot's of personal stuff and ramblings about everything that came to mind. The problem: nobody read it, and there was no recurring 'theme' or specific topics. So in the end, I lost any interest in it, despite that I liked blogging.  

I know, blogging is so 2000, but I decided to start it again. I have the feeling that it is my turn to give the web development community something back. Maybe it will be useful for someone, maybe not. It will be useful for me, to collect snippets, ideas and other articles all about web development (and some personal stuff, too). And it is part of the 2015-resolution to reclaim my own data, so I will host this thing by myself and use [kirby](http://getkirby.com) to do that.

Now let's see how long it will take for me to publish the first real blog post :-)
