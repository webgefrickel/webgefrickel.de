## What I do

I focus on frontend development and architecture, but I have absolutely no problem building full stack websites with small content management systems like WordPress, Kirby or ProcessWire.  I like DevOps and the terminal and care a lot about performance. And I like to teach about all that stuff and share my knowledge.

I mostly work with/for full-service agencies, other developers and graphic designers. I am a team player and don't give a fuck about tabs vs. spaces (as long as it's consistent). I'm not a designer, but I have an eye for what works and what doesn't.  I have a degree in computer science and tons of experience building websites.

If you want to work with me just give me a call or send an email to [kontakt@webgefrickel.de](mailto:kontakt@webgefrickel.de), so we can meet up over a coffee or tea and talk about your project.

Principles: 

## Principles

1. Everything I do, every single line of code is open source.  If it's mine, it's yours.
2. I am an honest and upfront person and we can talk about everything, and that's what I expect from you, too.
3. I don't do non-responsive websites anymore.  It's 2016.
4. A slow website is a bad website.  Performance matters, and I care a lot about it.
5. Blind, dialog-free implementation of website layouts is boring.  I like to question and to be critical.
6. I am open for *almost* any project, but if you are looking for a developer for your local right-wing party or hategroup: get lost.
7. I have high expectations regarding my own work.  In return I expect fair and punctual payment.
8. I'm not a magician: if your content and images are crap, your website will be crap. And there is nothing I can do about that by coding.
9. Search engine optimization is voodoo.  I prefer to build websites for the actual users than for ever-changing corporate algorithms.
10. I regard myself as a craftsman, and that's why I prefer to choose my tools by myself.  You can pry Vim from my cold dead hands.
11. I am only one person, if I feel that a project is too big for me, I will tell you and/or look for help.
12. Let's talk first. Maybe you can save a shitload of time and money, if we just meet up and chat about your ideas.
