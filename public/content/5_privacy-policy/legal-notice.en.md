No Analytics, no ads, no other trackers, no cookies/sessionStorage/localStorage, no third party content, no creepy social-media-like-buttons. No data or information is collected, nor is it or will ever be made available to third parties.

The server this website is hosted on does not write any access log files, there will be no IP or any other personal data stored in any logs ever. Your IP will only be used temporarily to deliver this website to your browser of choice, and will be deleted after closing the session. This is mandatory and on purpose, according to Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.

You have the right to request any data stored about you or request deletion or correction of your data by getting in touch with me, preferably via email (see sidebar).  You have the right to file a complaint with your national data protection authorities.  I would like to point out that online data transmission (such as when communicating via email) may be subject to security breaches.
