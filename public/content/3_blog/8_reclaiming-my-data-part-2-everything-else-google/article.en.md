Title: Reclaiming my data, Part 2 — everything else »Google«

Intro: Last year I tried to reclaim my data and to get rid of a lot of third-party services, especially some from Google, our favorite beloved big-data-kraken. In the first blog-post of this series I wrote about Google Mail, in this blog post I'll handle everything else.

Text: After one year of trying to reclaim my data I know can proudly say: I failed. Well, not in every aspect, but the idea of »getting rid of everything Google« just did not work out. I am still very happy with my [email provider](https://webgefrickel.de/blog/reclaiming-my-data-part-1-gmail), but there are some areas where I just can't do without some of their products. Let's talk about those in detail:

## The obvious one: Google Search
Google's search engine is just awesome. I use [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) as my default search engine, but sometimes I still have to go back to Google, because I just could not find the thing I wanted with duckduckgo. Especially Google's image search is way better. For most things duckduckgo is fine, and for work-related documentation-searches I more often use the Mac-App [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) or just go to stackoverflow directly :) Still, I find some things faster with Google.

## The easy one: Android
My main computer is a Macbook Pro, I have an iPhone and an iPad. I am definitely no Apple-fanboy and if I one day can get rid of everything Adobe, I will switch to linux instantly. But that and the whole »getting rid of Apple« is another story.
No personal device I own runs on Android — so that's solved :) The occasional testing and debugging on Android-devices works with the default setup, without having to surrender some private data, so I'm fine with Android so far. But I don't know what my next phone will be.

## The one I still use, like and need: Google Chrome
Well, I am a web developer, so I just have to test in Google Chrome, no way around it. For day-to-day surfing I use Mozilla Firefox and am very happy with it, and the [TOR Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) if I am really paranoid. But the Chrome Developer Tools are just indispensable and frankly still just way better than everything the other browser vendors have to offer. Usually I develop using a mix of both Firefox and Google Chrome Canary and then test in every other browser. But for normal private use: it's Firefox now.

## YouTube
There just is no alternative. Sure, there are tons of videos on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com), but the occasional episode of »Last Week Tonight«, tons of conference-talks and everything else to procrastinate the day away is and will be on YouTube.

## Google Maps
When searching for addresses or ways around town, Google Maps is still my go-to service. For hiking and the outdoors I really like OpenStreetMap, because the maps are way more detailed and accurate (I really dig the iOS-App [Maps3D Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/maps-3d-pro-gps-tracks-for/id391304000?mt=8)). Sometimes I use Apple Maps, but all in all: there's no real alternative to Google Maps.

## Google Hangouts
Some agencies I work for use Googles Hangouts for live video-chats and that's the main reason why I still have a Gmail-address. But there are some good and free alternatives, just to mention two favorites: [talky.io](https://talky.io/) and [appear.in](https://appear.in/). With Apples FaceTime not being an alternative, those free, WebRTC-based video chats for up to 8 persons should offer enough, so that you don't have to use Hangouts. While sometimes performance is better with Googles Hangouts, I really prefer those simple alternatives. 
For text-only chats I still like and use Jabber and IRC, self-hosted and Google-free.

## Google Analytics and Webmaster-Tools
For all my own projects and this website I switched to [piwik](https://piwik.org/) and I am very happy about this decision. If a customer of mine wants to use Google Analytics, I have no problem with that, but for every other project I will use Piwik.
I am no SEO-guy, but sometimes I have to use Googles Webmaster-Tools to check customers websites for errors in their sitemap or robots.txt. I only use this for work and have no private account or website associated with those tools.

## Google Fonts
I always prefer to include fonts directly via @font-face, so I don't really use the Google font service. There are many alternatives where you can get your free fonts, most beloved of all: [fontsquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/). They have a very nice selection of free fonts and their Generator is a very nice and often used tool.

And that's for all the Google services I used or still am using. I don't use Translate, Drive, Picasa, News their DNS or Docs — so I don't need an alternative for those :)
