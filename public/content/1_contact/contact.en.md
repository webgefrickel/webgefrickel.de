## What I do

My focus is on front-end development and architecture, and I love to build styleguides and component libraries for the web, and of course: accessible, inclusive and responsive.  But I have absolutely no problem building full stack websites with my favorite content management system Kirby.  I like DevOps and the terminal and care a lot about performance and efficiency.  And I like to teach about all that stuff and share my knowledge one-to-one or in workshops.

I mostly work with/for full-service agencies, other developers and graphic designers.  I am a team player and don't give a fuck about tabs vs. spaces (as long as it's consistent).  I'm not a designer, but I have an eye for what works and what doesn't.  I have a degree in computer science and tons of experience building websites.

If you want to work with me contact me via email: [kontakt@webgefrickel.de](mailto:kontakt@webgefrickel.de), so we can meet up over a coffee or tea and talk about your project and ideas.

Principles: 

## Principles

1. If you are racist, sexist, antifeminist, homophobic, a weapons dealer or just some other kind of asshole, I won't work with you.
2. I am an honest and upfront person and I like to question and to be critical.  And that's what I expect from you, too.
3. I don't do slow, non-responsive, non-accessible websites, and I won't debate doing so.
4. I have high expectations regarding my own work.  In return I expect fair and punctual payment.
5. When working with me, you are paying for a service. I am not a servant. There is a difference. 
6. I prefer to build websites for actual users, rather than for your liking or SEO-algorithms.
7. I'm not a magician: if your content is crap, your website will be crapâ€”there is nothing I can do about that by coding.
8. I have to concentrate while programming, so I often don't immediately reply to calls or emails.
9. I regard myself as a craftsman, so I prefer to choose the tools I work with by myself.
10. I am only one person, if I feel that a project is too big for me, I will tell you and/or look for help.
