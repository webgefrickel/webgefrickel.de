      <p>
        Happy New Year everyone! We all had a rather rough 2021, some definitely more than others. But we also had our fair share of beautiful memories and moments during this asshat-of-a-year, and I wish you all a lot of those for 2022!
      </p>

        <strong>Get vaccinated, stay healthy, love y'all.</strong>

        If you are interested in how I work nowadays: have a look at <a href="https://github.com/webgefrickel/kalong">kalong</a> (in constant progress, for smaller projects), or ask the awesome people from <a href="https://viu.ch">VIU</a>, with whom I work on different kind of projects.<br />
        Regarding work-related requests, as a disclaimer: for now, I am not open for any new projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you just want to chat or stay in contact: I'd love to make you a coffee or tea at my office, in our garden or in some Videochannel. Or just write me a letter via email or even a postcard. I mean it—you can still find me on the interwebs, but I chose to not really participate any longer—I'd rather give you my full attention.
